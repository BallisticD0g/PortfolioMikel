            <h2>My Story Runing The CyberGrizzlies Esports Club</h2>
            <p>
                The Story start in the year 2019 when I enrolled at Georgian and one of my classmates wanted to show me the esports club.
                At first, I enjoyed being apart of teams and playing with a community, but I shortly come to want more.
                I then in 2020 am put in charge of the Club as the pandemic lockdowns were being put in place, at that point the club was vary much broken.
                My sole goal was to bring everyone together I then had to come up with innovative ways to keep members constantly engaging with each other.
                After a couple months of planning, I had come up with a system to keep students engaged and committed to the club in for their duration of their program at Georgian College.
                From that I learned 3 key skills Team Leadership, Team management and the skill of More. from there the club is still thriving and growing to even be the largest Club at Georgian to even earn the Changemaking Club 22/23 Award, awarded by the GCSA (Georgian College Student Association).
            </p>

                <h3>Team Leader</h3>
                <p>
                    Team Leadership was the most important skill it applied to everything I did as president. 
                    I learned vary quickly how to be a good, understanding, firm, unshakable team leader after managing my first Esports Teams 
                    I learned other skills such as: reading people and how well they will work together. To be upfront and honest.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Wheather it was directly managing teams managing departments planning out structure, by strong and
                    clear communication and being able to keep a what every I was tasked with in check as well as always 
                    looking to improve them, all of these aspects of the club taught me how to be an exemplary manager.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Skill of More</h3>
                <p>
                    This is what I consider to be the most important skill, the skill of more,
                    in other words to seek out improvement seek criticism to improve and better your self and to have an open mind 
                    and considerate of other options.
