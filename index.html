            <h2>My Story Runing The CyberGrizzlies Esports Club</h2>
            <p>The Story start in the year 2019 when i enroled at Georgian and  one of my clasemaets wanted to show me the esports club. 
                At first I enjoyed bening apart of teams and playing with a comunity but I shortly come to want more.
                I then in 2020 am put in charge of the Club as the pandemic lockdowns were being put in place, at that point the club was vary much broken and my sole gole was to bring everyone together
                I then had to come up with inovative ways to keep members engaed and consitanly engain with eachother.
                After a couple months of plainig I had come up with a system to keep students engaed and comited to the club in for their duration of thier program at Georgian College 
                and from that I leard 3 key skils Team Leadership, Team magment and the skill of More.
            from there the club is stil thriving and growing to even be the largest Club at Georgian ot even earn the Changmaking Club 22/23 Award, awarded by the GCSA(Georgian College Student Association)</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Team Leader</h3>
                <p>Team Leadrship was the most important skill it aplied to everything I did as president. I leard vary quickly how to be a good understanding firm unshakable 
                   team leader after manging my first Esports Teams I learnd other skills such as: reading peple and how well ythey will work together. To be upfront and honest</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Manegment</h3>
                <p> Wheather it was directly mangnig teams managing dpartments planing out struckture,
                    by strong and clear communication and being able to keep a things in check aswaell as alweys lookingto improve them,
                    all of these acpects of the club taught me how to be a staple maanger. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Skill of More</h3>
                <p>This is what I consider to be the most important skill, the skill of more, 
                    in other words to seek out improvement seek ctrisimie to imporve
                    and better your self and to have na open mind and considerate of other options</p>
